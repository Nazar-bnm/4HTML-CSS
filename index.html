			<h2>Review</h2>
				<p>Introduction. This is Apple like we've never seen before. Apple like we never thought we'll see. To begin with, there's supposed to be no better iPhone than the iPhone 6. That's the sort of thing you'd expect of Apple. Come September every year, the world grabs a bag of popcorn and gets ready to watch Apple's bestest iPhone yet come on stage in all its glory.

				That's what we did too, minus the popcorn, which by the way would've had nothing to do with the bitter aftertaste the presentation left. And no, we don't mean Apple's live streaming blunder.

				Things actually started off nicely with the announcement of the long overdue screen size bump, and we didn't get a cheaper option this time - we were treated to possibly a bigger, better iPhone to go with the best iPhone to date. How Apple - it takes another iPhone to beat the iPhone.</p>
